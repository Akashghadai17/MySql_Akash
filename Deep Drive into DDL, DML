Hard Delete
-----------
-Completely removes the data from the database.
-Not recoverable once deleted.
-No trace of deleted data.
-Frees up storage space.
Sql:
    DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 1;

Soft Delete
-----------
-Marks data as deleted (e.g., is_deleted = true) but keeps it in the database.
-Easy to recover.
-We can trace deleted data.
-Increases database size over time.
Sql:
    ALTER TABLE students ADD is_deleted int;
    UPDATE students SET is_deleted = 1;
    SELECT * FROM students WHERE is_deleted =1; 
    UPDATE students SET flag=0 WHERE id=1;

Create Table from another existing Table
----------------------------------------
Approach1: (Create Table with Data) 
Sql:
    CREATE TABLE Student_Details AS SELECT * FROM user;
    SELECT * FROM Student_Details;

    | [id] | [name]  | [age] |
    |  1   | Ghadai  |  30   |
    |  2   | Akash   |  30   |
    |  3   | Ashu    |  30   |
    |  4   | Abhi    |  30   |
    |  5   | Biswa   |  30   |

Approach2: (Create Table without Data)
Sql:
    CREATE TABLE Student_Details2 AS SELECT * FROM user where 1=2;
    SELECT * FROM Student_Details2;

    | [id] | [name]  | [age] |
              OR
Sql:
    CREATE TABLE Student_Details3 LIKE user;
    SELECT * FROM Student_Details3;

    | [id] | [name]  | [age] |

Copy data with INSERT INTO … SELECT Command
-------------------------------------------
-We can copy data from one to another using INSERT INTO … SELECT command.
Sql:
    INSERT INTO Student_Details2 SELECT * FROM user;
    SELECT * FROM Student_Details2;
    
    | [id] | [name]  | [age] |
    |  1   | Ghadai  |  30   |
    |  2   | Akash   |  30   |
    |  3   | Ashu    |  30   |
    |  4   | Abhi    |  30   |
    |  5   | Biswa   |  30   |
