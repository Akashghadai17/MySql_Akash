Load Data from CSV file into Database Table
-------------------------------------------
Example#1: 
          -Load the `employee3.csv` file into a table named `employees`. 
          Ensure the header row is ignored. 

          -Load data from MySQL workbench
          -Go to MySQL Workbench 🡪 Right click on database 🡪 Click on 
           Table Data Import Wizard.

Column Aliasing
---------------
-An alias is a temporary name assigned to a table or a column in a query.
-Alias is temporary and only exists for the duration of the query.
-Alias name can be given after column name with or without AS key word. 
-If alias name contains multiple words, then enclosed with in double quote 
 or single quote or back tick because space is not allowed in name. 

Example#2:
Show “department” as “Dept” and “hire_date” as “Joining_Date”.

Sql:
    SELECT first_name AS Emp_Name, salary AS Money FROM employees;
    | Emp_Name  | Money |
    |-----------|-------|
    | Diane     | 5330  |
    | Clarence  | 3617  |
    | Eugene    | 4877  |
    | Philip    | 5259  |
    | Ann       | 2094  |
    | Charles   | 5167  |
    | Russell   | 3762  |
    | Jacqueline| 6923  |

Working with NULL Values
-------------------------
-Represents missing, unknown, or inapplicable data.
-We can get record with null values using IS NULL, IS NOT NULL.
-We can handle missing values using COALESCE.

IS NULL / IS NOT NULL 
---------------------
-It is used to test whether a column having null value or not. 
Syntax: 
        SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL; 
        SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

Example:
Find all employees where id IS NULL.
        SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id IS NULL;

        | id | first_name | last_name | department_id | salary | years_worked |

Write a query to update salary  as 6000 where department_id  is null.
        UPDATE employees SET salary = 6000 WHERE department_id IS NULL;

Write a query to delete record where department_id is null. 
        DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id IS NULL;

COALESCE Function
-----------------
-COALESCE() returns the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions.

-Evaluates expressions from left to right
-Returns the first NOT NULL value
-If all values are NULL, it returns NULL
-Commonly used to handle NULL values and provide default values

Syntax:
      COALESCE(expr1, expr2, expr3, ...)

Example 1:
      SELECT COALESCE(1, 2, NULL);
➡Output: 1
➡ First value 1 is NOT NULL, so it is returned.

Example 2:
      SELECT COALESCE(NULL, 1, 2);
➡ Output: 1
➡ NULL is skipped, next non-NULL value is 1.

Example 3:
      SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, 1);
➡ Output: 1
➡ First two values are NULL, third value 1 is returned.

Example 4:
      SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, NULL);
➡ Output: NULL
➡ All values are NULL, so result is NULL

Example:
      Replace NULL department values with `NA` using `COALESCE`.
      SELECT coalesce(department_id, 'NA') FROM employees;  -- if any department_id=Null then it assign NA.

      Write a query that calculates each employee’s total compensation by adding their salary to their bonus.
      SELECT emp_id, salary, bonus, salary + bonus AS total_compension FROM employees;

      SELECT emp_id, salary, bonus, salary + coalesce(bonus, 0) AS total_compension FROM employees;
